A roguelike about *furusiya*, the ancient code of chivalry and valor of Muslim knights. You can read a bit about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furusiyya).

The target experience is: what is the best combination of skills (and stats) I can use to most efficiently dispatch these enemies?

Built with Python 3 and TDL.

# Playing the Prototype

We're still prototyping.

- `git clone https://github.com/nightblade9/furusiya`
- `cd furusiya`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `git checkout dev`
- `python3 main.py` (or, on Windows: `python main.py`)

## How to Play

- Mouse-over anything to see the name
- Arrow keys to move, bump into stuff to attack, `g` to get items
- `i` to use items (inventory/items)
- If you have a bow, `f` to aim; auto-targets, mouse to pick a new target; `f` again to fire
- In `prototype/config.json`, you'll find lots and lots (and lots) of things you can tweak to see what style of gameplay you like.
