A roguelike about *furusiya*, the ancient code of chivalry and valor of Muslim knights. You can read a bit about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furusiyya).

The target experience is: what is the best combination of skills (and stats) I can use to most efficiently dispatch these enemies?

Built with Python 3 and TDL.
